# BEDS-SBS

Overwiew:
BEDS-SBS code controls the experimental equipment used for Brillouin echoes distributed sensing (BEDS).
 
Getting Started:
Required equipment:
1. Agilent DS081204B Oscilloscope
2. Agilent MXG Analog Signal Generator 100kHz-40GHz N5183A
3. Tabor 2.3HS/s Arbitrary Waveform Generator WX2182B
4. General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) cables

Required Software:
1. MATLAB 2014a running on Windows XP
2. MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox
3. MATLAB GUIDE (GUI development environment)
4. Interchangeable Virtual Instruments (IVI) driver
 
The equipment and software listed above are used to control the data acquisition process in a BEDS stimulated Brillouin scattering setup. BEDS is a distributed temperature/strain/inhomogeneity sensor.
